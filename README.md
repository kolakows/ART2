# ART2

File `art2.py` contains implementation of ART2 network, as described in [[2]](#2). 


`art2_not_used.py` is an attempt of making a gist of the ART2 network, based on [[1]](#1). Compared to `art2.py`:

- L1 layer's operations are reduced to a simple normalization of input,
- pattern is showed only once per episode, in ART2 nomenclature, 'slow learning' is implemented.

Raport.pdf contains a summary of performed tests (written in Polish).
